In this modern era, we have a lot of programming languages.  
Almost all of us use different web services in our daily life (Eg. Weather report, currency conversion, enquiring Gold rates, cricket scores). 

Our browser is the point of contact, to make the request to the server, receive the response from the server, process the response and render it to the user. 
A web server may be implemented with any programing language like Java, python etc. 
Our browser can understand Javascript. So there has to be a common, language-independent data transmission between a web application and a web server.
